# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to draw conclusions about possible forcings of stream intermittency in a Seventh Order reach of the Arkansas River through analysis of the timeseries of river stage ,aquifer level, meteorological forcings, and agricultural water as well as geologic analyses of soil characteristics and geophysical surveys of the riverbed. This project aims to assess ecosystem response to river drying.

# Contribution
Kyle participated in this project in the Summer of 2020 through the <a href="https://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/gipIndex.html#:~:text=Interns%20will%20gain%20experience%20with,to%20attract%20highly%20qualified%20candidates.">Kansas Geological Survey's Geohydrology Internship Program</a>. He undertook preliminary data investigations in looking at cliamte, agricultrual, and hydrologic timeseries. He also helped conduct electrical resistivity surveys of the riverbed to estimate riverbed subsurface heterogeneity.
