# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to develop an automated device that can measure the exchange of groundwater and surface water in surficial bodies.  This is a continuation of the work by Pacheco-Castro (2017) and builds upon Solder (2016).

# Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge Daniel Dominguez for his invaluable help in building the physical seepage meter.  Without him, this project would not have been possible.
